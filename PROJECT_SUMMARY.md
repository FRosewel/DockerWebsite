   - Create new repository (e.g., "my-personal-website")
   - Choose Public visibility for class sharing

3. **Upload to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Verify CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
   - Ensure all tests pass in the automated pipeline
